# Hi, I'm Tashrif Apon
I've been ecstatic about web developement ever since I got to transform a Python script accessible to a larger audience, "Islamic Midnight Calendar." Providing people access to important projects inaccessible or hard to find/access ignites my passion. Furthermore, providing people with website-adapted Python scripts and Excel spreadsheets that I find useful keeps me excited.
I'm current looking on the look for roles in backend & full-stack web developement, ideally writing in Python. I'd especially love to work at a company that either allows room for creativity or does not have the hassle of corporate politics or both. If you're hiring, let's chat.
* 💻 I've been coding in Python primarily for 2 years, using Flask for 1
* 🔨 I'm the founder of LPAedu
* 🚧 I'm currently building a website on PowerApps for the MTA
* 🚧 I'm also working on webpages using Python (with Flask) and MySQL
* ☎️ You can reach me at (929) 346-9867 (please text first, scammers love me) or tashrifapon2001@gmail.com, your preference.
