# Hi, I'm Tashrif Apon
<p> I've been ecstatic about web development ever since I got to transform a Python script accessible to a larger audience, "Islamic Midnight Calendar." Providing people with website-adapted Python scripts and Excel spreadsheets that I find useful keeps me excited.</p>
<p> I'm currently looking for full-time roles in backend & full-stack web development, ideally writing in Python and/or C#. I'd especially love to work at a company that either allows room for creativity and without hostile corporate politics.</p>

* 💼 I'm currently a SWE Intern at the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, where we use the .NET umbrella via C# and SQL
* 💻 I've been coding in primarily Python for 3 years, using Flask for 1
* 🔨 I was the lead developer of LPAedu
* 🔨 I built a web app with automation on PowerApps and PowerAutomate for the MTA
* 🚧 I'm also working on webpages using Python (with Flask) and looking to implement MySQL
* ☎️ If you're hiring, know someone that is, want to collaborate or see where we can go, let's chat. You can reach me at (929) 346-9867 (please text first) or tashrifapon2001@gmail.com
