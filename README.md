# Hi, I'm Tashrif Apon

<p> I've been ecstatic about web development ever since I got to transform a Python script accessible to a larger audience, "Islamic Midnight Calendar." Providing people with website-adapted Python scripts and Excel spreadsheets that I find useful keeps me excited.</p>
<p> I'm currently looking for full-time roles in backend & full-stack web development, ideally writing in Python and/or C#. I'd especially love to work at a company that encourages creativity and be placed on a team with a great manager.</p>

<p> ☎️ If you're hiring, know someone that is, want to collaborate or see where we can go, let's chat. You can reach me at (929) 346-9867 (please text first) or tashrifapon2001@gmail.com</p>
