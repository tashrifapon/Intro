# Hi, I'm Tashrif Apon
<p> I've been ecstatic about web development ever since I got to transform a Python script accessible to a larger audience, "Islamic Midnight Calendar." Providing people with website-adapted Python scripts and Excel spreadsheets that I find useful keeps me excited. </p>
<p> I'm currently looking on the look for roles in backend & full-stack web development, ideally writing in Python. I'd especially love to work at a company that either allows room for creativity or does not have the hassle of corporate politics or both. If you're hiring, let's chat. </p>

* 💻 I've been coding in Python primarily for 3 years, using Flask for 1
* 🔨 I was the lead developer of LPAedu
* 🚧 I'm currently building a website on PowerApps for the MTA
* 🚧 I'm also working on webpages using Python (with Flask) and looking to implement MySQL
* ☎️ You can reach me at (929) 346-9867 (please text first) or tashrifapon2001@gmail.com, your preference
